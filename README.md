You know DALL-E? What would happen if their website is offline? Exactly, you could no longer generate images. This project solves that problem. So I made a GUI for DALL-E via WebView. Not a big project, but still very practical.

# 👷 How does it works? 👷

Well, actually simple. I downloaded the original page and then put it into a WebView window. And I open the Colab page in the default browser. Not much, but it's more practical if you only have to type DALL-E in the taskbar.

# 🏃 How to run? 🏃

Ehhhm yes ... That's actually simple. 

Either you download the source code and then enter in Terminal/CMD:<br>
```python3 Engine.py``` (Before that go to the directory where you have the source code) </br>

or, if you use Windows, then just download the .exe <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>.
