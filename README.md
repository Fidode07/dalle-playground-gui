You know DALL-E Playground? What would happen if their website is offline? Exactly, you could no longer generate images. This project solves that problem. So I made a GUI for DALL-E via WebView. Not a big project, but still very practical.


# DALL-E Playground was not made by me! You can find the original <a href="https://github.com/saharmor/dalle-playground">here</a>. My mission was just to make a GUI to make it easier to use.

# 👷 How does it works? 👷

Well, actually simple. I downloaded the original page and then put it into a WebView window. And I open the Colab page in the default browser. Not much, but it's more practical if you only have to type DALL-E in the taskbar.

# 🏃 How to run? 🏃

Ehhhm yes ... That's actually simple. 

Either you download the source code and then enter in Terminal/CMD:<br>
```python3 Engine.py``` (Before that go to the directory where you have the source code) </br>

or, if you use Windows, then just download the .exe <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fidode07/dalle-playground-gui/master/Compiled/DALL-E.exe">here</a>.

Good, but now Google Colab has opened in your browser (Whaaat)??? Yep, that's normal. Now you have to do following:

1. execute the first code block at the top (it contains lines like !git clone ...)

2. go to the 2nd codeblock and choose the model you want (The small one is good, because it runs very well). Now execute this codeblock too.

3. the last codeblock (WOW SUPER COOL - I know). Just execute it and wait until the server is started. Then copy the URL that you got and paste it into the GUI.

That's it. There is nothing more to do. Congratulations, you can now tell an AI some nonsense and it will paint it for you.<br>

# ⚠️Important (For Linux users):⚠️

1. GTK or QtPy must be installed
2. Python Requirements: ```pywebview```
